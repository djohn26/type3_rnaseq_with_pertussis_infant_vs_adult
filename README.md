# type3_rnaseq_with_pertussis_infant_vs_adult
This is an RNAseq data analysis pipeline for RNAseq experiments done in the Carbonetti lab at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. Here we investigate the role of type 3 interferon signaling in the context of Bordetella pertussis infection in mice comparing both age and infection status in these mice.
